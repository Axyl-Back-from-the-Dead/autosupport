vc_disappeared = "Launch the installer and press Repair/Reinstall (you won't lose any of your vencord settings don't worry)\n\nThis is a normal occurrence that happens every so often (~ once a month, more frequently if using canary)"
vc_lag = "The most common cause of lag is poorly written css and themes\n\ntry temporarily disabling all your themes and your quick css and see if the lag is gone\n\nto then figure out which parts of your css are laggy, I recommend just removing small bits of it step by step until you figure out the culprit"
vc_devtools_logout = "Discord tries to protect you from getting scammed by “hiding” your token when you open DevTools, which means it deletes it from storage and only keeps it in memory in order to make it harder to obtain.\n\nIf you now close discord before closing DevTools again, your token will not be saved anywhere anymore and as a consequence you will be logged out\n\n**Solution: Close DevTools** before closing discord or better yet enable the **NoDevtoolsWarning plugin** which removes this “feature”"
vc_devtools_mem = "Discord on Windows uses 32bit electron which has a hard memory limit of 2gb. Discord’s memory management isn’t great so it will already get up to like 1.5gb ram usage if you are in a lot of servers and have it open for a while\n\nDevTools use a lot of memory so once you open them, they immediately push you over 2gb usage. Thus Discord runs out of memory and crashes\n\n**Solution**: use **Discord Browser** / [**Vencord Desktop**](<https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop>)"
vc_mobile = "We have an [Android app](<https://github.com/Vencord/Android>) embedding the Discord website\n\nHowever, as Discord’s mobile website has some issues (performance, usability, etc), chances are you won’t like it. In that case you will instead want to use one of the following mods focused on Mobile.\n\nDo note however that these mods are not related to / affiliated with Vencord, so we do not provide support for them in any way. Join their support servers for help & more info!\n\n- Vendetta (android/ios): [GitHub](<https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta>) - [Discord Server](<https://discord.gg/n9QQ4XhhJP>)\n- Enmity (ios only): [GitHub](<https://github.com/enmity-mod/enmity>) - [Discord Server](<https://discord.gg/rMdzhWUaGT>)\n- Aliucord (android only, very outdated but still works well if you like the old version of Discord): [GitHub](<https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord>) - [Discord Server](<https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU>)"
